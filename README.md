# Real-Time Color Identification using OpenCV

This project involves real-time color identification using OpenCV in Python. It uses a webcam to capture video frames, and when the user double-clicks on a pixel in the video frame, it identifies the color of that pixel and displays the color name along with the RGB values.

## Overview

Color identification is an essential task in computer vision and image processing. This project demonstrates a simple yet effective method to identify colors in real-time using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python. By leveraging the webcam feed and the ability to capture and process individual frames, this project provides a practical application of color identification.

## Features

- Real-time color identification using a webcam
- Display of color name and RGB values for the selected pixel
- Simple interface for users to interact with the application

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
